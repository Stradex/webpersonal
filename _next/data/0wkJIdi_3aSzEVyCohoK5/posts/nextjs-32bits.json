Few days ago I was working in my Next.js project, which is this website by the way, and I was having a great time working in my desktop computer that, of course, runs in a 64 bits operative system.</p>\n<p>But the issue was that a few days later I had to go to my girlfriend's house and I couldn't move my desktop computer to her house so I decided to bring my old Notebook. The issue was that I completely forgot that the Notebook was using a 32 bits version of Windows 10.</p>\n<p>Therefore when I tried to install all the necessary tools to continue working with my website project with Next.js, I found myself not being able to start the app for the NodeJS server was not starting.</p>\n<p>At first glance I thought it may be NodeJS, then I thought it was React but I lost a few hours trying to solve the problem.</p>\n<h3>How to fix it?</h3>\n<p>After trying with different versions of Next.js, NodeJS and React, I was finally able to find a build that allowed me to continue working with my Next.js app with that old computer that was running the OS in 32 bits.</p>\n<p><strong>This is the working build:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">    Next.js 12.2.5\r\n    React 18.2.0\r\n    Node 18.14.2\r\n    npm 9.5.0\n</code></pre>\n<p>With the versions of React, Node, npm and Next.js listed above I was able to finally get my Next.js app working with 32 bits.</p>\n<p>To force your project to use those specific versions of Next.js and React, you can edit your <strong>package.json</strong> file the following way, changing the values of the versions to use of next, react and react-dom.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"next\": \"12.2.5\",\r\n    \"react\": \"18.2.0\",\r\n    \"react-dom\": \"18.2.0\",\r\n  },\r\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Additional note</strong></p>\n<p>First I thought that I needed to force the use of <strong>Babel</strong> instead of <strong>SWC</strong> since I thought <strong>SWC</strong> was 64 bits only, but it seems that it works fine with <strong>SWC</strong>  too. But just in case, if you still can't get it to work with the versions of Node, React, Next and NPM that I told you, you can also force the use of <strong>Babel</strong> instead of <strong>SWC</strong> the following way.</p>\n<p><em>(This step is NOT necessary if you already made your Next.js app work in 32 bits with what I told you before.)</em></p>\n<p>Create a <strong>babel.config.js</strong> file with the following data:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">module.exports = {\r\n   presets: ['next/babel'],\r\n    \"plugins\": []\r\n};\n</code></pre>\n<h3>How to export Static HTML files</h3>\n<p>When trying to export static generated html files, you will face some issues for new Next.js versions use a new method to export.</p>\n<p>We will need to change the image loader to <strong>akami</strong> and set output to <strong>standlone</strong> in our Next.js configuration JSON.</p>\n<p>To generate the static generated files with this old version of Next.js, you will have to do the following.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <strong>next.config.js</strong> and set the following.</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">/**\r\n * @type {import('next').NextConfig}\r\n */\r\nconst nextConfig = {\r\n    output: 'standalone',\r\n     trailingSlash: true,\r\n    //BÃ¡sicamente este images : { unoptimized: true } fue el que me permitio generar los HTML\r\n    \r\n    images: {\r\n        unoptimized: true,\r\n        loader: 'akamai',\r\n        path: '',\r\n    },\r\n  }\r\n   \r\n  module.exports = nextConfig\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>Go to the root folder of your project in the terminal and write:\r\n<strong>npx next build</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Then write:\r\n<strong>npx next export</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Final thoughts</h3>\n<p>Even if you manage to make your Next.js project in 32 bits, remember that you will be using a old version of it, therefore you will face a lot of issues trying to work in such conditions for you will not be enjoying many bug-fixes and latest features of the framework, and many new libraries made for Next.js may won't work.</p>\n<p>This is only a temporary solution for anyone in a situation where there's NO way to have a 64 bits OS working. But don't even consider working for long in 32 bits, I don't want to encourage anyone to work in such architecture and please if you find yourself in this situation consider to change to 64 bits as soon as you can.</p>\n","title":"Next.js in 32 bits.","date":"2023-10-17","description":"In this post you will learn how to make Next.js to run in a 32 bits OS."}},"__N_SSG":true}
